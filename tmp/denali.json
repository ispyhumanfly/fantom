  "description": "Denali, formerly known as Mount McKinley, is the highest peak in North America at 20,310 feet. Located in Alaska's Denali National Park and Preserve, it experiences a subarctic climate with severe winter conditions. The mountain is known for its extreme weather, with temperatures often dropping below -40Â°F in winter. Its massive bulk creates its own weather patterns, and the summit is frequently shrouded in clouds. The mountain's base-to-summit rise of about 18,000 feet is greater than that of Mount Everest, making it one of the most prominent peaks in the world."
